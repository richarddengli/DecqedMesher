**DecqedMesher** is a Julia package for constructing primal and dual mesh objects present in tbe discrete exterior calculus formulation of quantum electrodynamics (DEC-QED) as detailed in the following papers:
- [Flux-based three-dimensional electrodynamic modeling approach to superconducting circuits and materials]([https://link-url-here.org]([https://github.com/dnpham23/DEC-QED](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.107.053704))

Eventually, **DecqedMesher** will be integrated into the larger [**DEC-QED computational toolbox**]([https://link-url-here.org](https://github.com/dnpham23/DEC-QED). Both packages are under active development.

**DecqedMesher** began as development during the 2022 Undergraduate Research Internship at IBM and Princeton (QURIP), as part of a collaboration between the following groups:
- Türeci Group, Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Princeton University
- Qiskit Community Team, IBM Quantum

We also thank Abeer Vaishnav, Nathalie de Leon, Hwajung Kang, and the rest of the 2022 QURIP cohort for their support.
